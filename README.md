# openpwnage
Open source iOS 8.4b4-9.3.6 32bit Semi-Untethered jailbreak

## Notice

iOS 9 patchfinder is by spv, iOS 8 patchfinder (not on this repo) by dora2-iOS. These patchfinders are based off of planetbeing's patchfinder. Please give thanks to them.

This shit was a cobbled together and is mostly other people's work and done way worse, please don't use this. I'd honestly recommend using Phoenix instead, it's better coded.
